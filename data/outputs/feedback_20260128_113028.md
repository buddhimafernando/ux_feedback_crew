## Feedback Items

### 🟡 Enhance visual feedback for user actions and content loading

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** Users need clear indicators that their actions (like posting or reacting) have been registered and that content is actively loading or refreshing. Lack of feedback can lead to uncertainty, repeated actions, or the perception that the app is slow or unresponsive, negatively impacting user confidence and efficiency.

**What to do:**
- When a user successfully creates a post using the 'What's on your mind?' input, display a brief, temporary toast message (e.g., 'Post created successfully').
- For interactive elements like reaction `icon_button`s (e.g., tapping emojis), implement a subtle visual animation or state change on the icon to confirm the user's action immediately.
- For `story_card` and feed `image` content, introduce skeleton loading states or loading spinners while data is being fetched, especially during initial load or refresh, to inform users about system activity.

**Wireframe changes:** Introduce a new temporary toast notification UI element (e.g., bottom-centered) for post confirmations. Update reaction `icon_button`s to show a brief animation or color change on tap. Add placeholder `story_card` and `image` elements (e.g., grey rectangles or shimmer effects) that animate into actual content as it loads.

### 🟢 Implement 'Undo' functionality for reversible actions

**Priority:** LOW

**Why it matters:** Users can make mistakes or change their minds. Providing an 'undo' option for actions like dismissing a post helps them recover gracefully from unintended interactions, reducing frustration and increasing their sense of control over the application.

**What to do:**
- When a user taps the 'Close (X) icon' on a post to dismiss it, instead of immediate permanent removal, display a temporary Snackbar or toast message (e.g., 'Post hidden') with an 'Undo' button. This message should disappear after a short timeout if no action is taken.
- Clearly define the consequence of actions like tapping the 'Close (X) icon' in the backend (e.g., temporary hide vs. permanent delete/report).

**Wireframe changes:** Add a new temporary Snackbar/toast UI element with a primary action button (e.g., 'Undo') that appears at the bottom of the screen after certain actions (e.g., dismissing a post).

### 🟡 Enhance error prevention for critical actions

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Why it matters:** Preventing errors before they occur saves users time and frustration. Performing unintended or irreversible actions, especially those with significant consequences, can lead to negative user experiences or data loss. Proactive prevention minimizes user regret.

**What to do:**
- For potentially destructive or critical actions (e.g., permanently deleting or reporting a post, which might be accessed via the 'More options (three dots) icon'), introduce a confirmation dialog (e.g., 'Are you sure you want to [action]?') to prevent accidental triggers.
- For the 'What's on your mind?' `text_input`, implement real-time inline validation if there are any specific constraints (e.g., character limits, required content for certain post types) to provide immediate feedback to the user.

**Wireframe changes:** Introduce a standard modal confirmation dialog UI element for critical actions (e.g., accessed via a context menu from the 'More options' icon). If applicable, add inline validation feedback (e.g., red text message, red border) to the 'What's on your mind?' `text_input` component.

### 🟢 Increase touch target size for notification badges

**Priority:** LOW

**Why it matters:** Small interactive elements can be difficult to tap accurately for all users, particularly those with motor impairments or large fingers. This leads to mis-taps, frustration, and an inefficient user experience, indirectly causing user errors.

**What to do:**
- Increase the effective touch target area for all `badge` components (e.g., '9+', '1', '2') to a minimum of 48x48 dp. This means the tappable region around the badge should be larger, even if the visual size of the badge text or icon itself remains small, without obstructing adjacent elements.

**Wireframe changes:** Adjust the interactive regions for `badge` components to be larger than their visual representation. This change would primarily be in the hit-testing area rather than a significant visual size increase of the badge itself.
