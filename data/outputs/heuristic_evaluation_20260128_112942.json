Introduce skeleton screens, loading spinners, or progress bars for feed content and stories that are still fetching data to keep users informed about system activity."

      "issue": "While the bottom navigation provides clear paths and a 'Close (X) icon' allows dismissal of a post, there is no explicit mention of an 'undo' mechanism for actions that might be performed accidentally or for which a user might change their mind (e.g., accidentally hiding a post).",

      "heuristic_name": "Error prevention",
      "severity": "medium",
      "issue": "The UI description doesn't explicitly detail mechanisms for error prevention, such as real-time input validation for the 'What's on your mind?' text input or confirmation dialogs before potentially destructive actions (e.g., permanently hiding a post via the 'Close (X) icon'). This could lead to users making unintended errors or performing actions they regret.",

      "improvement_suggestion": "Implement proactive error prevention strategies. For the 'What's on your mind?' input, provide inline validation if there are specific constraints (e.g., character limits, required fields, though less common for general posts). For actions that have significant consequences, introduce a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental triggers. Also, ensure interactive elements like notification badges are sufficiently sized to prevent mis-taps, which is an indirect form of error prevention related to target size."

    {
      "heuristic_name": "Visibility of system status",
      "observation": "The UI effectively uses notification badges ('9+', '1', '2') to communicate new activity and the active state of the 'Home' bottom navigation button (Facebook blue) clearly indicates the user's current location. The status bar provides essential system information like time and network status ('4G')."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Match between system and real world",
      "observation": "The design uses highly recognizable and standard icons (e.g., Add, Search, Messenger, Photo/Gallery, More options, Public/Globe), aligning well with user expectations. The language used, such as 'What's on your mind?' and 'Create story', is familiar and user-centric. The presence of localized text (Sinhala in the post) further demonstrates a strong match with the real world for its target audience."

    {
      "heuristic_name": "User control and freedom",
      "observation": "The fixed bottom navigation bar provides constant, clear 'emergency exits' to core app sections (Home, Reels, Friends, Marketplace, Notifications, Menu). The 'Close (X) icon' on a post offers users a direct way to dismiss content they may not wish to see, granting immediate control over their feed."
    },
    {
      "heuristic_name": "Consistency and standards",
      "observation": "The UI demonstrates excellent consistency across various elements. Color usage is consistent (Facebook blue for branding/active states, dark grey for secondary elements, red for badges). Typography maintains a clear hierarchy. The layout follows established social media patterns with a persistent header, horizontal story carousel, card-based feed, and fixed bottom navigation. Icons and interactive components maintain a consistent visual style throughout the screen."
